# Cryptsu's source code.
This is my source code for my CTF blogs :) 

## Influences

### Code structure
The structure of the code is inspired from the work of [jarv.is](https://github.com/jakejarvis/jarv.is). I just found this guy online and have no idea who he is, but he seems to know his stuffs :3 

### Visualization
For visualization, I got my inspirations from these websites, which are from CTF bloggers. While most of them are just adapted from already existed Hugo templates, which I could just found online, some of them have very cool contents (some I just copy the styles, sorry :<)

- https://chovid99.github.io/: For the homepage's icon and text typing stuffs.
- https://mystiz.hk/: For inspiring me to use Mono-fonts / have cool table of content on my page. He also writes really cool Crypto posts.

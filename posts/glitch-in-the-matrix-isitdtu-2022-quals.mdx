# Introduction

This is a crazy challenge that drained my team's brains :cry: and we couldn't solve it in time of the CTF :slightly_frowning_face: After 2 days of trying to brainstorm, we have finally be able to crack the code, with a little bit of luck :kissing: 

Since the intended solution will be provided by the author *catto* after the finals (**18/12**), which is over **ONE MONTH AFTER** from when I'm writing these lines (*why it gotta take so long catto* :sob: :sob: :sob:), I decided to create my own writeup to explain our method of solving this problem :kissing:

:br
# Challenge

## Description

The server generates a **securely random 64-bit hex string password** that is kept secret. We as the clients have to guess the secret password to get the flag.

The server gives us hints about the password through the output of the `encrypt(password)`, which is a function we can call as many times as we can, each time it seemingly produces a different output despite  feeding the same input to the function.

This writeup provides a way to obtain the flag with **8** outputs of `encrypt(password)` in a probability of about **$1/40$**.

# Analyzing stuffs...

Let's first dissect everything in the source code to see what it does and how to make sense of the data given to us :kissing: If you've already known what to expect, you can hop onto the next section to see the discussion of the solution :heart:

`encrypt(message)` converts `message` in hex form to its binary form `M` as a list of **0** and **1**s, 

```python
def encrypt(message: bytes) -> str:
    ...
	M = [b for c in message for b in map(int, "{:08b}".format(c))]
    ...
```



For each bit of `M`, it generates a random 64-bit value `C` (also a list of **0** and **1**s), 

```python
def random_bits(n: int) -> list[int]:
    return list(map(int, bin(random.getrandbits(n))[2:].rjust(n, "0")))
	
def encrypt(message: bytes) -> str:
    ...
    for bit in M:
        C = random_bits(64)
        ...
```



calls `f(C, [:64])` or `f(C, BASIS[64:])` depending on the current bit of `M`, appends the result of the call to the `ct` variable. 

```python
def encrypt(message: bytes) -> str:
    global BASIS
	...
    ct = []
    for bit in M:
        C = random_bits(64)
        ct = []
        for bit in M:
            C = random_bits(64)
            v = f(BASIS[:64], C) if bit else f(BASIS[64:], C)
            ct.extend(v)
```



`BASIS` is a global variable, a 2-dimensional list with size **128x128** with unknown content whose rows are shuffled in every call to `encrypt()`.

```python
assert len(SECRET_BASIS) == len(SECRET_BASIS[0]) == 128
BASIS = copy.deepcopy(SECRET_BASIS)

...
def encrypt(message: bytes) -> str:
    global BASIS
    random.shuffle(BASIS)
    ...
```



After loop, `ct` is then converted to its hex form and returned to the user. From this code, it is safe to assume that the value of `ct` is a list consisting of all **0**s and **1**s.

```python
def encrypt(message: bytes) -> str:
    ...
    ct = []
    for bit in M:
        ...
        ct.extend(v)
	ct = "".join(map(str, ct))
    return bytes([int(ct[i:i+8], 2) for i in range(0, len(ct), 8)]).hex()
```



Also, it can be deduced from `ct` and the type hints and operations of `f()`, which is just bunch of repeated **XOR**s of values in `v` and`M[i]` (`M` is `BASIS[:64]` or `BASIS[64:]`), that `BASIS` also consists of **128x128** values of **0**s and **1**s.

```python
def f(M: list[list[int]], C: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    v = [0] * len(M[0])
    for c, m in zip(C, M):
        if c:
            v = [x ^ y for x, y in zip(v, m)]
    return v
```



All of these **XOR**s and **2-dimensional arrays** and **lists** of **0**s and **1**s seem to point everything into viewing those things as **addition** of **matrices** and **vectors** in $GF(2)$. And it turns out we can view:

- `BASIS` as a **128x128** matrix in $GF(2)$.

- As for `f(M, C)` , there are two ways to view this function:
  
  You can either view it as an operation that produces a **1xn** vector `v` by multipling a **1xm** vector `C` with an **mxn** matrix `M`, 
  $$
  \overrightarrow{v} = \overrightarrow{C} * M
  $$
  or as an operation that generates a linear combination of the rows in `M` with coefficients on `C`. 
  $$
  \begin{matrix}
  \overrightarrow{v} = \sum_{i=0}^{m} {C_i}\overrightarrow{{M_i}} & & C_i \in \{0, 1\}
  \end{matrix}
  $$
  I'll choose to see it in the 2nd way because it helps when discussing the solution later :grin:
  
- `encrypt(message)` randomizes `C` and uses `f(BASIS[...], C)` to produce random linear combinations of the first 64 rows of `BASIS` or the last 64 rows of `BASIS` depending on the current looping bit of `M ` or `message` *(0 - first 64, 1 - last 64)*. All of the resulting vectors are stored in `ct` before converted into hex form and returned to the user.

- `ct` is a list of **64** different **128-dimensional** vectors $\overrightarrow{v_i}$ in $GF(2)$ that is either spanned by the last 64 rows of `BASIS` or the first 64 rows of `BASIS`. Each vector in `ct` corresponds to a bit in `password`.

Now we know how to view the encrypted password, let's discuss the solution!


:br
# How to know the bits of `password`?

In order to get all the bits of `password`, we must be able to classify which vector $\overrightarrow{v_i}$ in `ct` belongs to which vector space. Is $\overrightarrow{v_i}$ generated from `BASIS[:64]` *(so $password_{i}$ is 0)*, or `BASIS[64:]` *(so $password_{i}$ is 1)*? 

![](gen-from-where.png)

We don't even have `BASIS`, so if we know a particular vector is formed by a set of 64 rows in `BASIS`, we can't even tell if that set positions at the top of the matrix or the bottom! The only bet for us is to know **which bit is different from which bit by comparing the vector space that spans the corresponding vectors**. If we've got the mapping of which bit is different from which bit, we can set one random bit to be **0** and let the mapping does the rest. This gives us the probability of finding the correct answer at $1/2$ (*given the mapping, of course :smiley:*)

![](no-yes.png)

# Notations

Before moving on, I think I should introduce some notations here to help discussing the next part.

- **Bit i** of `password` is $password_i$.

- $\overrightarrow{v_{i, a}}$ is the **i-th** vector of `ct`, generated at **a-th** time we request to get `encrypt(password)`.

- $S_{i, a}$ be the set of rows in `BASIS` that generates $\overrightarrow{v_{i, a}}$. 

  Based on the rule of this challenge, we can see that in an **$a$-th** `encrypt` operation:

  - $S_{i, a} = $ `BASIS[:64]` when $password_i = 0$, 
  - $S_{i, a} = $ `BASIS[64:]` when $password_i = 1$, 

  Which leads to these properties:

  - $S_{i, a} = S_{j, a}$ when $password_i = password_j$.
  - $S_{i, a} \neq S_{j, a}$ when $password_i \neq password_j$.

- $P(e)$ is the **probability** of some event $e$ happening.

- $\#S$ is the **length** of set $S$.


:br
# Matrix1.0

In *Glitch in the matrix 1.0*, comparing $password_i$ and $password_j$ is very much doable. To solve this challenge, we have to provide a way to differentiate between the vectors that are either generated from `BASIS[:64]` or `BASIS[64:]`.

Because `password` doesn't change every-time we call `encrypt` and most importantly, `BASIS` is not changed in the entire runtime of the program, $\overrightarrow{v_{i, a}}$ is generated from the same set of 64 vectors as $\overrightarrow{v_{i, b}}$ for any $a, b$, or $S_{i, a} = S_{i, b}.$

This means that we can request **64** `encrypt`s to obtain $\overrightarrow{v_{i, 0}}, \overrightarrow{v_{i, 1}}, \overrightarrow{v_{i, 2}}, ..., \overrightarrow{v_{i, 63}}$ that is in the same vector space as `BASIS[:64]` or `BASIS[64:]`. In order to verify if $password_{i} = password_{j}$, or $S_{i, a} = S_{j, a}$, I created a **128x128** matrix that looks like this:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
	\overrightarrow{v_{i, 0}} \\
	\overrightarrow{v_{i, 1}} \\
	... \\
	\overrightarrow{v_{i, 62}} \\
	\overrightarrow{v_{i, 63}} \\
	\overrightarrow{v_{j, 0}} \\
	\overrightarrow{v_{j, 1}} \\
	... \\
	\overrightarrow{v_{j, 62}} \\
	\overrightarrow{v_{j, 63}} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
If the rank of this matrix is $64$, $\overrightarrow{v_{i, 0}}, \overrightarrow{v_{i, 1}}, \overrightarrow{v_{i, 2}}, ..., \overrightarrow{v_{i, 63}}, \overrightarrow{v_{j, 0}}, \overrightarrow{v_{j, 1}}, \overrightarrow{v_{j, 2}}, ..., \overrightarrow{v_{j, 63}}$ **comes from the same span of 64 vectors**, so $S_{i, a} = S_{j, a}$, and we can conclude that $password_i = password_j$. If the rank of this matrix is $128$, the opposite is true and we get $password_i \neq password_j$.

In script, we fix $i = 0$ and let $j$ runs from $1 - 63$ to generate the mapping and recover the `password` with probability of $1/2$.



:br
# Matrix2.0

*Glitch in the matrix 2.0* is the updated version where `BASIS` is shuffled every-time we request a new `encrypt(password)`. This means that the property that:

> $\overrightarrow{v_{i, a}}$ is generated from the same set of 64 vectors as $\overrightarrow{v_{i, b}}$ where $a \neq b$, or $S_{i, a} = S_{i, b}$,

is not correct this time around, which is very sad :sob:. We also cannot refer to `BASIS[:64]` and `BASIS[64:]` as constants anymore.

## Probability hint 

After a while, a hint came out from the author:

![](hint-from-author.png)

And we still had no idea what the hell she is talking about until the end of the CTF :frowning: 

...

:br
And then, a thought comes to my mind: 

While it's true that $\overrightarrow{v_{i, a}}$ is not gonna be generated from the same set of 64 vectors as $\overrightarrow{v_{i, b}}$ if $a \neq b$, some of the vectors in those sets might overlap. Let $P(S_{i, a} \cap S_{i, b} = \{\})$ be the probability of $S_{i, b}$ purposefully choosing a set of different 64 vectors to $S_{i, a}$ in a list of 128 vectors, then:
$$
P(S_{i, a} \cap S_{i, b} = \{\}) = 1/{C_{128}^{64}} = 4.17\text{e-38}
$$
proving that this is a very, very, very, very, very unlikely event. 

This gives me an insight that the sets $S_{i, a}$ and $S_{i, b}$ almost always overlap, and from above we've got:
$$
P(\#(S_{i, a} \cup S_{i, b}) \le 127) = 1 - 1/{C_{128}^{64}}
$$
![](set-overlap.png)

This might be the "probability" thing *catto* was talking about! Also from this another idea is formed!

:br
## Detecting $\lfloor{\frac{128}{n}}\rfloor + 1$ similar bits in `password`

Let's say we generate `encrypt(password)` $n$ times for $n \ge 3$.

:br
And somehow, for a certain value of $password_i$, we obtain the vectors $\overrightarrow{v_{i, 0}}, \overrightarrow{v_{i, 1}}, ..., \overrightarrow{v_{i, n-1}}$  such that: 
$$
\#(S_{i, 0} \cup S_{i, 1} \cup S_{i, 2} \text{ } \cup \text{ } ... \text{ } \cup S_{i, n-1}) \le 127
$$
This means that $S_{i, 0} \cup S_{i, 1} \cup S_{i, 2} \text{ } \cup \text{ } ... \text{ } \cup S_{i, n-1}$ contains about **127 rows** in `BASIS` except **one/some row(s)**. The remaining row(s) of `BASIS` would be present in the set of $S_{j, 0} \cup S_{j, 1} \cup S_{j, 2} \text{ } \cup \text{ } ... \text{ } \cup S_{j, n-1}$ where $password_j \ne password_i$ as $S_{j, a}$ always contains the vectors that $S_{i, a}$ doesn't have.



:br
And somehow, we can find a set of $\lfloor{\frac{128}{n}}\rfloor + 1$ elements $\{password_{i_0}, password_{i_1}, ..., password_{i_{\lfloor{\frac{128}{n}}\rfloor}}\}$,  where $password_{i_0} = password_{i_1} = \text{ } ... = password_{i_{\lfloor{\frac{128}{n}}\rfloor}}$.



:br
So, this matrix $M$, which has $n(\lfloor{\frac{128}{n}}\rfloor + 1) > 128$ rows,
$$
M = 
\begin{bmatrix}
	\overrightarrow{v_{i_0, 0}} \\
	\overrightarrow{v_{i_0, 1}} \\
	... \\
	\overrightarrow{v_{i_0, n-1}} \\
	... \\ 
	... \\
	\overrightarrow{v_{i_{\lfloor{\frac{128}{n}}\rfloor}, 0}} \\
	\overrightarrow{v_{i_{\lfloor{\frac{128}{n}}\rfloor}, 1}} \\
	... \\
	\overrightarrow{v_{i_{\lfloor{\frac{128}{n}}\rfloor}, n-1}} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
must have rank $\le 127$ as all of these vectors are generated from the set of $S_{i, 0} \cup S_{i, 1} \cup S_{i, 2} \text{ } \cup \text{ } ... \text{ } \cup S_{i, n-1}$, which contains only $\le 127$ rows of `BASIS`.


:br
If we change just one of $password_{i_k}$ to a different bit from the rest, the above matrix $M$ will most likely have higher rank *(often $128$*) than before, since there will be a row in $M$ that is a linear combination of the vectors including the one(s) that is/are not in $S_{i, 0} \cup S_{i, 1} \cup S_{i, 2} \text{ } \cup \text{ } ... \text{ } \cup S_{i, n-1}$. 


:br
Here comes our mechanism to detect $\lfloor{\frac{128}{n}}\rfloor + 1$ similar bits in `password`. In particular, if we randomize $\{{i_0}, {i_1}, ..., {i_{\lfloor{\frac{128}{n}}\rfloor}}\}$ enough times and construct $M$, we might stumble across a situation where $M$ has rank $\le 127$ and we can use this to say that $password_{i_0} = password_{i_1} = \text{ } ... = password_{i_{\lfloor{\frac{128}{n}}\rfloor}}$ with **high probability**.


:br
However, in order for this to work, we need to make sure to choose $n$ so that both of these conditions hold:

1. $\#(S_{i, 0} \cup S_{i, 1} \cup S_{i, 2} \text{ } \cup \text{ } ... \text{ } \cup S_{i, n-1}) \le 127$ occurs in **high probability**.

2. Choose $\{{i_0}, {i_1}, ..., {i_{\lfloor{\frac{128}{n}}\rfloor}}\}$ that $password_{i_0} = password_{i_1} = \text{ } ... = password_{i_{\lfloor{\frac{128}{n}}\rfloor}} = 0$ in **high probability**.


:br
It turns out, if scenario **1.** occurs more likely, scenario **2.** will occur less likely and vice versa, so we need to balance $n$. Through trials and errors, I've decided to choose $n = 8$ and the correct set $\{{i_0}, {i_1}, ..., {i_{\lfloor{\frac{128}{n}}\rfloor}}\}$ is found in a probability of about $1/20$, after brute forcing at most $400000$ sets.

:br
## Recover the remaining bits in `password`

Remember the matrix $M$ from the last section? We can use it to detect the rest of the bits in `password`. For every $j$-th bit in `password` that $j \notin \{{i_0}, {i_1}, ..., {i_{\lfloor{\frac{128}{n}}\rfloor}}\}$, I decided to construct a new matrix $N$ from $M$ that is:
$$
N = 
\begin{bmatrix}
	M \\
	\overrightarrow{v_{j, 0}} \\
	\overrightarrow{v_{j, 1}} \\
	... \\
	\overrightarrow{v_{j, n-1}} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
Then compares $rank(N)$:

- $= rank(M)$, we have $password_j = password_{i_0} = password_{i_1} = \text{ } ... = password_{i_{\lfloor{\frac{128}{n}}\rfloor}}$.

- $> rank(M)$, we have $password_j \neq password_{i_0} = password_{i_1} = \text{ } ... = password_{i_{\lfloor{\frac{128}{n}}\rfloor}}$.

With this information, we can recover `password` with a probability of $1/2$.

:br
# Solve code

This piece of code implements what I've just described above, with some small changes:

- Constructs $M$ by brute-forcing through a bigger random list, $\{{i_0}, {i_1}, ..., {i_{\lfloor{\frac{128}{n}}\rfloor + 1}}\}$ instead of just $\{{i_0}, {i_1}, ..., {i_{\lfloor{\frac{128}{n}}\rfloor}}\}$. This allows $M$ to have even more rows, ensuring us that we get $M$ where $rank(M) \le 127$ actually because of $\#(S_{i, 0} \cup S_{i, 1} \cup S_{i, 2} \text{ } \cup \text{ } ... \text{ } \cup S_{i, n-1}) \le 127$, not just some false positives.

  

- Uses `multiprocessing` to find the list $\{{i_0}, {i_1}, ..., {i_{\lfloor{\frac{128}{n}}\rfloor + 1}}\}$ that yields $rank(M) \le 127$ faster.

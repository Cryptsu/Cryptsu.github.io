# Bluestein's algorithm / Chirp-Z transform

## Like Multiplying 2 polynomials

Turns out there's a very clever way we can transform the **FFT** problem for $N$ coefficients to another **FFT** problem for $2^s$ coefficients. There's no way a dumb person like me can think stuffs like this. But anyways, here's the explanation: 

This is an another way we can look at the **FFT** matrix multiplication above:
$$
f(\omega_N^{j}) = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1}f_k \text{ } \omega_N^{jk}
$$
<br/>

Since $jk = \frac{j^2 + k^2 - (j-k)^2}{2}$, we have ($\omega_{2N} = \omega_N^{\frac{1}{2}}$):

$$
\begin{matrix}
f(\omega_N^{j})                             & = &                   & \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} & f_k                            & \omega_N^{jk} \\
                                            & = & \omega_{2N}^{j^2} & \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} & f_k                            & \omega_{2N}^{k^2} \text{ } \omega_{2N}^{-(j-k)^2} \\

f(\omega_N^{j}) \text{ } \omega_{2N}^{-j^2} & = &                   & \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} & f_k \text{ } \omega_{2N}^{k^2} & \omega_{2N}^{-(j-k)^2}
\end{matrix}
$$
<br/>

If we let:
- $f(\omega_N^{j}) \text{ } \omega_{2N}^{-j^2}$ be $Z_j$.
- $f_k \text{ } \omega_{2N}^{k^2}$ be $X_k$.
- $\omega_{2N}^{-(j-k)^2}$ be $Y_{j-k}$.
<br/>

We'd obtain the following equation:
$$
\begin{matrix}
Z_j = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1} X_k * Y_{j-k}
\end{matrix}
$$

One may look at this and might relate to the fact that this is like multiplying `2` **"polynomial-ish"** $X(x) * Y(x) = Z(x)$. 
<br/>

Like, given any 2 polynomials $m(x) * n(x) = o(x)$, you would notice that:

$$
\begin{matrix}
o_j = \sum_{k=0}^{j} m_k * n_{j-k}
\end{matrix}
$$

where $m(x) = \sum_{i} m_i x^i$, $n(x) = \sum_{i} n_i x^i$, $o(x) = \sum_{i} o_i x^i$. However, there's a difference in the sum:

description: I didn't solve any Crypto challenges but my teammates carry 🥰

For a while now, after the ~*death*~ postponed activities of `u0K++`, I've got a chance to join in `idek` team *(thanks `lanleft` so much because I'm incredibly socially awkward...)*. I really like the guys there, they are so vibrant, fun and incredibly smart. I'm not any of those descriptions though, and so, in this CTF, I sliently watch them carry 😗

## Challenge
This challenge provides a some sort of **Diffle-Hellman key exchange-ish**- protocol in the form of `64x64` matrices in `ZZ`. The premise is very straight-forward. You're given:
- A matrix `Q = B * B.tranpose()`, `B` unknown and random.
- 2 matrices `M1`, `M2` generated from `Q` and unknown matrices `U1`, `U2`:
```python
M1 = U1.transpose() * Q * U1
M2 = U2.transpose() * Q * U2
```

The challenge has 2 matrices `S1`, `S2` that act as the shared secrets to this protocol.
```python
# Yeah, these 2 things are the same :3
S1 = U1.transpose() * M2 * U1
S2 = U2.transpose() * M1 * U2
```

It seems like the challenge would be impossible if the matrices `U1`, `U2` are any arbitary matrices, so a condition is added for their generation:
```python
N = 64

def find_poly():
    while True:
        n = random.randint(2, N - 1)
        d = gcd(N, n)
        m = n // d
        if m > 1 and not is_prime_power(m):
            return cyclotomic_polynomial(n)


def circulant_gen():
    h = 1
    R = QuotientRing(ZZ[x], x^N - 1)
    for i in range(100):
        f = find_poly()
        h = R(f * h)
    v = h.list()
    l = N - len(v)
    for i in range(l):
        v.append(0)
    M = matrix.circulant(v)
    return M

# key exchange
U1 = circulant_gen()
U2 = circulant_gen()
```

Anyways, the goal is to recover `flag` from its encrypted `enc` value, which is created like this:
```python
ss = hashlib.sha256(str(S1).encode()).digest()
enc = bytes([x^^y for x, y in zip(FLAG, ss)])
print(enc.hex())
```

## Analysis
This challenge has my brain go buckeroo 😵‍💫, because I don't know what to focus on. At first, I thought the polynomials used to create the matrices `Ux` has something important to do with all of this, but all of that just go to nowhere. My teammate `A~Z` had an idea of using `QuadraticForm` do something with the factorization of matrices, but I had no idea what that is *(and still doesn't)*. After a while, he also abandoned that idea as well and realized the actual solution thanks to the suggestion of `蛋捲鯛魚燒`.

From here, let's just refer to matrices `M1`, `M2` as $M$ and `U1` and `U2` as $U$.

In the end, it turns out everything just tie into the fact that $U$ matrices are circulant. For more details, you can visit [this link](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Circulant_matrix). But for a recap, a circulant matrix is an `nxn` matrix that has this form:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
    c_0    & c_{n-1} & ...    & c_2    & c_1     \\
    c_1    & c_0     & ...    & c_3    & c_2     \\
    c_2    & c_1     & ...    & c_4    & c_3     \\
    \vdots & \vdots  & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots  \\
    c_{n-1}& c_{n-2} & ...    & c_1    & c_0     \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The circulant matrix has a bunch of properties, one of them is $AB = BA$ which allows this protocol to work (`S1 == S2`). However, `蛋捲鯛魚燒` realized that it has a very special property:

Indeed, it turns out **EVERY CIRCULANT MATRIX** has the **same set of *(normalized)* eigenvectors!** Which means that given a circulant matrix $U$, it doesn't matter what $U$ is, as long as it's circulant, we can know $P$ in $U$'s diagonalization form $U = PDP^{-1}$. Quote **Wikipedia**:

![](/images/posts/m0lec0n-ctf-2023/circulant-key-property.png)

However, we still doesn't know what $D$ is in this case. But here's the cool stuff: We can find $D$ through $M$ and $Q$. Let's write $M$ in terms of $P$ and $D$:
$$
\begin{matrix}
M & = & U^T              & Q & U            \\
  & = & {P^{-1}}^T D P^T & Q & P D P^{-1}   \\
\end{matrix}
$$

What's great about this is that you can multiply $P^T$ to the left of $M$ and $P$ to the right of $M$ and you can see some sort of symmetry:
$$
\begin{matrix}
P^T M P & = & D P^T Q P D
\end{matrix}
$$

Let $f(M) = P^T M P$ and now we have:
$$
\begin{matrix}
f(M) = D f(Q) D
\end{matrix}
$$

Because $D$ is a diagonal matrix, `A~Z` has a very interesting insight:

After we get $D$, we find $U = PDP^{-1}$, which then we can compute `S1` -> `ss` -> solve `flag`!!! 

## Solve script
```python
from sage.all import *
from ast import literal_eval
import hashlib

# EVERY nxn circulant matrices has a fixed
# set of eigenvectors, which can be computed very
# easily based on the roots of unity.
# https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Circulant_matrix
N = 64
C = ComplexField(4096)
w = exp(2 * C(pi) * C(i) / N)

# Read outputs from file.
lines = open("output.txt", "r").readlines()
Q  = Matrix(ZZ, N, N, literal_eval(lines[0]))
M1 = Matrix(ZZ, N, N, literal_eval(lines[1]))
M2 = Matrix(ZZ, N, N, literal_eval(lines[2]))
enc = bytes.fromhex(lines[3].strip())

# This allows us to diagonalize circulant
# matrices very easily.
# ( Let U1 = P D1 P^-1, U2 = P D2 P^-1 )
P = [[w**(i*j) for i in range(N)] for j in range(N)]
P = Matrix(C, P)

# But we don't want to diagonalize it, 
# instead, we take advantage of the properties
# of diagonalized multiplications.
#    U   = P D P^-1 
# => U.T = P^-1.T D.T P.T 
#        = P^-1.T D P.T      (since D.T == D)

# Let f(M) = P.T * M * P
#  => f(M) = D * f(Q) * D
fQ  = P.T * Q  * P
fM1 = P.T * M1 * P
fM2 = P.T * M2 * P

# This means
# f(M)[i, i] = D[i, i]^2 * f(Q)[i, i] 
# => D (or D1, D2) is recoverable.
# => U (or U1, U2) is recoverable.
s1 = sqrt(fM1[0,0] / fQ[0,0])
D1 = [s1]
for i in range(1, N):
    D1.append(fM1[0, i] / (s1*fQ[0, i]))
D1 = matrix.diagonal(C, D1)
U1 = P * D1 * P**-1
U1 = Matrix(ZZ, [[round(col.real()) for col in row] for row in U1])

S1 = U1.T * M2 * U1
ss = hashlib.sha256(str(S1).encode()).digest()
flag = bytes([x^y for x, y in zip(enc, ss)])
print(flag)
```

The flag is: `ptm{1s_7h15_l1n34r_0r_qu4dr4t1c}`

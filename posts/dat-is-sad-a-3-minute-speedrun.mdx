description: A simple Hastad attack with e=65537... What can go wrong?
coverImage: simple-but-slow
---

This challenge is about a simple server send out RSA-encrypted data of a flag. Here we are going to use a classic exploit of Hastad's attack, but with a small twist of optimising code base :)

We have a hidden flag value `M`, then is encrypted to become `C` by:
$$
C = M^{65537} \mod N
$$
where `N = pq`, where `p` and `q` are two big *(512-bit)* primes and `N > M`. This makes `N` 1024-bit. The server generates these `C` and `N`, then send them to us, the client as many times as we like, each time a different `C` and a different `N > M` composed by entirely different `p`s and `q`s.

:br

# IDEA

Notice `M` does not change all the time, nor it is being randomly padded. We could use the Hastad's attack by getting `65537` different `C`s, *(:code[C<sub>1</sub>], :code[C<sub>2</sub>], ...)* and `65537` different `N`s *(:code[N<sub>1</sub>], :code[N<sub>2</sub>], ...)* and recover the actual :code[M<sup>65537</sup>] by:
$$
M^{65537} \mod lcm(N_1, N_2, ...) 
\\ = crt([C_1, C_2, C_3, ..., C_{65537}], [N_1, N_2, N_3, ..., N_{65537}])
$$
:br

If we consider each of the `N` composed by different prime numbers, then :code[lcm(N<sub>1</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, ...) = N<sub>1</sub>N<sub>2</sub>...N<sub>65537</sub>] so
$$
M^{65537} \mod lcm(N_1, N_2, ...)  = M^{65537} \mod N_1N_2...N_{65537}
$$
:br

Since
$$
M < N_i \\\text{for every i} \in [1, 65537] \\
\rightarrow M^{65537} < N_1N_2...N_{65537}
\\ \rightarrow M^{65537} \mod N_1N_2...N_{65537} = M^{65537}
$$

:br
To recover `M`, all we need is to take the `65537-th` root of :code[M<sup>65537</sup>], which can be done very fast using *Sagemath*, and we're done!

# Collect C-N Pairs

Collecting **65537** `C`s and `N`s is doable. Since for each request the server sends us **100** `C-N` pairs, we just need to send `(65537//100 + 1) = 656` **requests** in total. Took a while (about an hour), but definitely feasible.

```python
from   pwn   import remote
from   tqdm  import tqdm, trange

##### socket #####
host = '34.136.227.174'
port = int(25455)

def recving():
    ns = []
    cs = []
    io = remote(host, port)
    for _ in range(100):
        data = io.recvline().split(b':::')
        ns.append(int(data[0]))
        cs.append(int(data[-1]))
    io.close()
    return cs, ns

##### main #####
# Get results
cs, ns = [], []
for _ in trange(65537 // 100 + 1):
    result   = recving()
    cs      += result[0]
    ns      += result[1]

open('c.py', 'w').write(f'cs = {cs}')
open('n.py', 'w').write(f'ns = {ns}')
```

After we have our values `C` and `N` in two files: `c.py` and `n.py`.

From that, we just need to solve this by:

```python
from sage.all import *
from Crypto.Util.number import *
from c import c
from n import n

m_65537 = crt(c, n)
print(long_to_bytes(Integer(m_65537).nth_root(65537)))
```

:br
# Reality is Harsh

So we waited...

One hour... Two hours... Three hours... *(actually I give up after 10 mins, this is just for dramatic purposes, but my friend Timmy run for another 2 hours :V he could confirm)*

And it did not give us any output. 

Why did it take so long???

:br

## Sage's CRT is Slow

Here's the snippet of code from Sage's implementation of `crt()`, function `CRT_list()` that handles when the inputs to `crt()` are lists.

```python
### Snippet from CRT_list()
x = v[0]
m = moduli[0]
from sage.arith.functions import lcm
for i in range(1, len(v)):
    x = CRT(x,v[i],m,moduli[i])
    m = lcm(m,moduli[i])
return x % m
```

:br

Basically, what this function does is it builds up the calculation like so:
$$
\text{C: list of rems, N: list or mods}\\
\\
x_1 \leftarrow C_1 \text{ ; } m_1 \leftarrow N_1   \\
\\
\text{loop}\\
x_i \leftarrow CRT([x_{i-1}, C_i], [m_{i-1}, N_i]) \\
m_i \leftarrow lcm(m_{i-1}, N_i)                   \\
\\
\text{for i} \in [2, len(C)]
$$
The result of the algorithm is :code[x<sub>len(C)</sub>].

The algorithm works fine, it gets the job done. The problem lies when the number of values inputed at `CRT` **IS BIG**. 


:br

To demonstrate what I mean, let's dig in to see what happens in each loop of that `CRT_list()` function.

:code[x<sub>0</sub>] has **1024** bits. Let's replace this number of bits with `b` and assume that the time taken to write data to a `b`**-bit number** is :code[T<sub>b</sub>], and it scales up linearly with `b`. 

:br
After each loop, we need to create a new variable :code[x<sub>i</sub>] with `+b` bits more than :code[x<sub>i-1</sub>] and write data to it. So in time, the number of bits of :code[x<sub>i</sub>] will be like this: 
$$
[b, 2b, 3b, 4b, ..., 65537b]
$$
The total time taken to generate variables and write data will be like this:
$$
T_{total} = \sum_{i=1}^{65537}T_{ib} = \sum_{i=1}^{65537}iT_b = T_b\frac{(65537)*(65537 - 1)}{2} = 2147516416T_b
$$
As we can see, for `b = 1024`, the time taken to write one number is neglectable, but *2 billions of similar writes* would make a HUGE different.

 
:br
Let's analyse the runtime in **O-notation**. Replace `65537`, the amount of numbers used in CRT, with `k` we have:
$$
T_{total} \approx \frac{T_bk^2}{2} = O(k^2)
$$
Not a very good runtime to be honest :v:


:br

And I haven't mention the runtime of the [multiply algorithm](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Karatsuba_algorithm) between 2 numbers, which has a more dominant runtime. It has :code[O(b<sup>log<sub>2</sub>3</sup>)] with respect to the number of bits, and is used a lot during CRT. Here I will stick to the write-data algorithm as it is easier to elaborate :kissing: 

:br

## From O(k<sup>2</sup>) to O(klogk)

Instead of doing **CRT** sequentially from left to right each loop like Sage's algorithm, what we did in each loop is doing **CRT** for EACH 2 NUMBERS in the array. After `k/2` runs we create 2 new list of `k/2` `2b`**-bit** remainders and modulus. Then we do the same thing again, yield 2 new list of `k/4` `4b`**-bit** remainders and modulus... Until the list of remainder has only one element :kissing:

:br

At the first `k/2` runs, the runtime for write data to `k/2` `2b`**-bit** number is:
$$
T_{2b} * \frac{k}{2} = 2T_{b} * \frac{k}{2} = kT_b
$$
:br

The next `n/4` run yields the runtime of:
$$
T_{4b} * \frac{k}{4} = 4T_b * \frac{k}{4} = kT_b
$$
And so on...

:br

Since the number of runs divides by 2 each loop, we have in total `log(k)` loops, which yield the total runtime *for creating and writing memory* of:
$$
T_{total} = kT_b\log(k) = O(k\log(k))
$$
:br

Comparing to the previous :code[O(k<sup>2</sup>)] algorithm, we have achieved a speed up of about (for `k=65537`):
$$
\frac{k}{2} / log(k) = \frac{65537}{2 * \log(65537)} \approx 2048 \text{ times}
$$
:br

*Again, this is only the speed up ratio for creating and writing new memory, for speeding up in multiplication and other more time-consuming activities in `crt()`, it's different, but I guess we could just expect some value around this.*

:br

With that in mind, let's implement the code *(btw for some reason the algorithm runs faster when we consider in each loop doing **CRT** for every **8 NUMBERS** instead of **2**)*:

```python
from sage.all import *
from Crypto.Util.number import *
from c import c
from n import n

c = c[:65537]
n = n[:65537]

                prod = 1
                for _m in m[i:i+SEG_SIZE]:
                    prod *= _m
                newR.append(crt_)

m_65537 = CRT_(c, n, debug=True)
print(long_to_bytes(Integer(m_65537).nth_root(65537)))
```
:br

And the algorithm only took us **3 minutes** to run, which is definitely faster than infinity :)

![](result-dat-is-sad)

# Even Better: From 3 to 1 minute (update)

It's great that my writeup got so many praises from the author, *cothan* who is also a long-time Crypto player :smiley: I'm crying in happiness right now **TwT**. Although I came up with the algorithm, but I got stuck and gave up half-way through. It was *Timmy* who stick to my idea and implement it to solve it *(thank you very^n where n goes to infinity much)* and get juicy points :kissing: And he also noticed for somehow, grouping **8** `crt()`s together seems to be a better choice than **2**(?)

![](praise-from-cothan)

*cothan* also mentioned that applying parallelism to the algorithm is a very good way to improve the algorithm.

![](optimisation-1)

Now, I'm not familiar with Julia much, but parallelism is do-able with so much ease. The key here is noticing that in each loop, each result of `crt()` calls *does not affect each other* until the next loop. This implies that we can have multiple calls to `crt()` running simultaneously in a loop, which will improve a lot our performance. If it's coded in **Julia** instead of **Python**, it would have been better. For now, let's stick to **Python**. With a few twitches to the code, here's what we've got:

```python

And this is the result on my 8-thread, 4 core machine :dancers::dancers::dancers::dancers: wow!! 3 times faster.

![](optimisation-2)

# ... and better?

... And we can do even better than this! You see, *Sage's* `crt()` only returns the result of the new remainder, it doesn't return the new moduli, although it also calculate the new moduli on the run as well! This makes us having to recalculate it later just to append to our new moduli array, which seems redundant to be honest.

```python
### Snippet from CRT_list()
x = v[0]
m = moduli[0]
from sage.arith.functions import lcm
for i in range(1, len(v)):
    x = CRT(x,v[i],m,moduli[i])
    m = lcm(m,moduli[i])
return x % m # Should also return m
```



Sage's code base is already nice, so I just pull the functions `crt()` and `CRT_list()` out from the source and modify it a little bit so that they could return the new moduli as well:

With this final piece of code, we have reduced about 20 seconds worth of runtime. Which is actually pretty crazy, considering that the intended solution for this challenge was running the code for about **3 hours** by writing optimised `CRT()` code in **Julia** instead of **Python** *(confirmed by cothan himself)*!! Now, a low-end user can run this algorithm within minutes, seconds even! With a machine running with many more cores, it can perform this task like a breeze!

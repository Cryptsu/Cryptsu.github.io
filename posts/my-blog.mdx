# Casino 2 - Attack on gorand - TETCTF-2023

*(flashback)*
> **Me**: Hey, I think this challenge uses a faulty version of *[cosmos/iavl](https://github.com/cosmos/iavl)*. Cuz you know, like, according to the *go.mod* file, it uses **v0.19.2**, which is not the latest version. And then there is this [change log](https://github.com/cosmos/iavl/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) of version **v0.19.3** saying it prevent sth sth and then there is this [blog page](https://sanebow.me/bnb-hack-iavl-explained) posted around that release saying *iavl* is not good etc etc. I think this is the vulnerability.

> **L.T.**: I think *ndh* doesn't want to tease our brain too hard, so he wouldn't come up with sth this complex. Let's crack the random function.

> **Me**: I agree. There are so many words and crazy stuffs in this blog so it's probably isn't true.

> **L.T.**: Yeah...

> **Me**: Yeah...

Well, that turns out to be the intended vulnerability of the challenge. But we're not here to discuss that *(that blog still hurts my brain btw :'()* because we actually figured out a way to crack the random function :happy: *(yey)*

I've seen the discussion around the challenge and I saw players talking about brute-forcing with multiple cores to get the seed of Go's PRNG. Well, we actually found a way to predict the result without having to find the seed :kissing:

Although this approach only gives us the correct output $\frac{1}{4}$ of the time, I still think it is interesting so it would be fun to share it :slightly_smiling_face:

## TL;DR

---

**:warning: (Because I want to write a blog about the details of my discovery, including methods to find it, other methods you can go, what's the challenge is all about, etc, ..., this blog will be a very, probably unnecessarily, lengthy one, and if you're not ready to read it, here is a small recap on what's about to come :slightly_smiling_face:):warning:**

>  *(now come to think of it I might have put the whole stream of consciousness in here...)*

---

Consider a list of outputs from `rand.Intn(n)` named $R$ where `n` is a relatively small number $< 2^{31}$. The $i$-th element $R_i$ will most likely fall into one of these 4 cases:
$$
R_i = R_{i-607} + R_{i-273} \mod {n}
\\ \text{or} \\
R_i = R_{i-607} + R_{i-273} + 1 \mod {n}
\\ \text{or} \\
R_i = R_{i-607} + R_{i-273} - 2^{31} \mod {n}
\\ \text{or} \\
R_i = R_{i-607} + R_{i-273} - 2^{31} + 1 \mod {n}
$$
and we use **one of these 4 equations as our strategy to guess the next output**. Each round we bet `balance`**/2** (*or some number that is linear to `balance`, like `balance`**/3** or sth, your pick :kissing_smiling_eyes:*). This strategy allows our money not to run out too quickly when we guess the wrong number while still guarantees our money growing exponentially if we win. Since **win amount** is $>>$ **lose amount**, we will benefit in the long run and hence can reach our target `balance`.

## Challenge description

>  *(if you know all the functionalities of the code files, you may skip this section anyways :slightly_smiling_face: )*

This challenge is about a Go Application that emulates some sort of online casino stuffs. You interact with the server by sending some JSON data as input, and expect some text data as output.

<img src="/images/posts/casino2/example-command.png" />

You can:

- **register** your `username` and get $2023$ coin units as your initial `balance`. The server also restricts you from registering more than **100 accounts** or creates another account with an existing `username`, but it doesn't matter in the context of solving this challenge anyways.

  

  *<u>**example request:**</u>*

  ```json
  { "recipient": "Casino", "command": "Register", "username": "Orrrrrr" }
  ```

  *<u>**code:**</u>*

  ```go
  // casino.go
  // ...
  const MaxPlayers = 100
  const InitialBalance = 2023
  
  func (c *Casino) Register(username string) error {
  	exist, err := c.tree.Has([]byte(username))
  	if err != nil {
  		log.Fatal(err)
  	}
  	if exist {
  		return errors.New("player-exists")
  	}
  	if c.numAccounts >= MaxPlayers {
  		return errors.New("max-players")
  	}
  	c.numAccounts += 1
  	c.setBalance(username, big.NewInt(InitialBalance))
  	fmt.Printf("Added user: %s.\n", username)
  	return nil
  }
  // ...
  ```




- **bet** a number `n` between $[0, 2023)$ with some non-negative `amount` (*if you put in a negative number, the server will correct it to become positive anyways :sneezing_face:  -- this became the exploit point of the first challenge, Casino 1, because it didn't check whether the amount is negative or not.*) 

  
  
  The server also generates a number `n` between $[0, 2023)$. If your `n` $\neq$ server's `n`, you will lose :\<, else you will win :>
  
  - *when you lose*, you lose `amount` and you will have `balance` - `amount` coin units left.
  - *when you win*, you gain $2022$ * `amount`.

  Also, the server will tell you **what `n` they generated**. *( \<- This will become important later on )*
  
  

  **<u>*example request:*</u>**

  ```json
  { "recipient": "Casino", "command": "Bet", "username": "Orrrrrr", "amount": 123, "n": 456 }
  ```
  
  <u>***code:***</u>
  
  ```go
  // casino.go
  // ...
  func (c *Casino) Bet(username string, amount *big.Int, n int) error {
  	currentBalance, err := c.getBalance(username)
  	if err != nil {
  		return err
  	}
  	amount.Abs(amount)
  	if currentBalance.Cmp(amount) < 0 {
  		return errors.New("insufficient-balance")
  	}
  	r := rand.Intn(2023)
  	if r == n { // correct guess
  		reward := new(big.Int).Mul(amount, big.NewInt(2022))
  		currentBalance.Add(currentBalance, reward)
  		c.setBalance(username, currentBalance)
  		fmt.Printf("YOU WIN! Current balance: %d (+%d).\n", currentBalance, reward)
  	} else {
  		currentBalance.Sub(currentBalance, amount)
  		c.setBalance(username, currentBalance)
  		fmt.Printf("YOU LOSE (%d != %d)! Current balance: %d (-%d).\n", r, n, currentBalance, amount)
  	}
  	return nil
  }
  // ...
  ```



- **show balance with proof**: You give your `username` to the server and it gives you the `balance` along with a `proofData` to prove that you actually own that amount of money.

  
  
  **<u>*example request:*</u>**
  
  ```json
  {"Recipient": "Casino", "Command": "ShowBalanceWithProof", "Username": "Orrrrrr"}
  ```
  
  ***<u>code:</u>***
  
  ```go
  // casino.go
  // ...
  func (c *Casino) ShowBalanceWithProof(username string) error {
  	value, proof, err := c.tree.GetWithProof([]byte(username))
  	if err != nil {
  		log.Fatal(err)
  	}
  	if value == nil {
  		return errors.New("player-not-exist")
  	}
  	proofData, err := proof.ToProto().Marshal()
  	if err != nil {
  		log.Fatal(err)
  	}
  	fmt.Printf("%d, %s\n", new(big.Int).SetBytes(value), base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(proofData))
  	return nil
  }
  // ...
  ```

​		

- **get the flag**. In order to retrieve the flag, we need to provide our `balance`. We also need to provide a `proofData`, which is generated from the previous section and it's there so that we cannot lie about our `balance`. The more `balance` we have, the more bytes of the flag is revealed to us.

  **<u>*example request:*</u>** 
  
  ```json
  {"Recipient": "FlagSeller", "Command": "PrintFlag", "Username": "Orrrrrr", "Balance": 674575536530165491749660868130299036066707815144061494924879197906525335081820072153268675251126472982500904339158951753600, "proof_data": [26, 46, 10, 7, 79, 114, 114, 114, 114, 114, 114, 18, 32, 109, 131, 92, 77, 137, 187, 133, 233, 12, 114, 115, 54, 175, 113, 149, 190, 174, 14, 165, 57, 118, 134, 67, 152, 122, 170, 139, 119, 113, 127, 202, 200, 24, 186, 6]}
  ```
  
  ***<u>code:</u>***
  
  ```go
  // flag_seller.go
  // ...
  func (fs *FlagSeller) PrintFlag(usename string, balance *big.Int, proofData []byte) error {
  	var pbProof iavlproto.RangeProof
  	if err := proto.Unmarshal(proofData, &pbProof); err != nil {
  		return fmt.Errorf("bad proof format: %w", err)
  	}
  	proof, err := iavl.RangeProofFromProto(&pbProof)
  	if err != nil {
  		return fmt.Errorf("bad proof format: %w", err)
  	}
  	if err := proof.Verify(fs.dbRootRetriever()); err != nil {
  		return fmt.Errorf("proof verification failed: %w", err)
  	}
  	if err := proof.VerifyItem([]byte(usename), balance.Bytes()); err != nil {
  		return fmt.Errorf("proof verification failed: %w", err)
  	}
  
  	l := balance.BitLen() / 8
  	dot3 := "..."
  	if l >= len(fs.flag) {
  		l = len(fs.flag)
  		dot3 = ""
  	}
  	fmt.Printf("Your flag is: %s%s\n", fs.flag[:l], dot3)
  	return nil
  }
  // ...
  ```

## Analysis

The number of flag bytes revealed to us scales linearly with the number of **bytes** there are in our `balance`, so we probably need to have a lot of money to get the full flag. **For example**, if the flag is $50$ bytes long, we need at least $2^{50*8} = 2^{400}$ coin units to get all of it, which is a really really really big number comparing to our humble $2023$ coins at the beginning.

There are two ways we may want to approach this problem.

### The IAVL bug

First one is the **IAVL bug**. You can see that users' data is stored in the `Casino` structure, which contains a `tree` object. This `tree` data type comes from `github.com/cosmos/iavl` library.

```go
// casino.go
import (
// ...
	"github.com/cosmos/iavl"
// ...
type Casino struct {
	tree        *iavl.MutableTree
	numAccounts int
}
    
func NewCasino() *Casino {
	tree, err := iavl.NewMutableTree(db.NewMemDB(), 128, true)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
// ...
```

Upon inspecting the `go.mod` file, you can see that it uses version `v0.19.2`, which is nothing surprising until you find out that the real-world `IAVL` is version `v0.19.4` by the time the challenge was released.

```go
// go.mod

module casino

go 1.19

require (
	github.com/cosmos/iavl v0.19.2
	github.com/golang/protobuf v1.5.2
	github.com/tendermint/tm-db v0.6.6
)
```

So, I began searching for clues, like *"iavl v0.19.2 attack"*, *"cosmos iavl v0.19.2 tree vulnerability attack"*, then I came upon this blog:

<img src="/images/posts/casino2/vuln-search.png" />

which was suspicious, because it released around the time of `v0.19.3` according to this [change log](https://github.com/cosmos/iavl/releases). **" Pass IAVL Proof Verification?"** Maybe there's some way we can craft a fake `proofData` to send to the `PrintFlag` function for any `balance` we wish to? Anyways, reading through the blog *(not the one I screenshot-ed above, [this one, dunno why it's not in Google search anymore :confused:](https://sanebow.me/bnb-hack-iavl-explained) that one's just for showcase that we tried to find stuffs)*, it seems like whatever bug they found, it was really bad. So I thought to myself: **This must be it**.

Then I noticed the change in `v0.19.3`, it seems like the change in the newer version suggests something about the attack we should come up with :)

<img src="/images/posts/casino2/change-log-to-attack.png" />

However, our investigation about the tree stuff ends here, because this is where me and my teammate stopped *(you know why :slightly_smiling_face:)*; and also this blog's about attacking the Go's `rand` stuff :kissing: If you want to read more about the **IAVL bug**, you should visit these two links, provided by a fellow Discord member:

- [Binance Chain Bridge Exploitation Writeup - Part 1](https://blog.verichains.io/p/binance-bridge-exploitation-preliminary)
- [Binance Chain Bridge Exploitation Writeup - Part 2](https://blog.verichains.io/p/binance-chain-bridge-exploitation)

### The Go `math/rand` stuff

The second way you could dig at this challenge is by exploiting the `rand.Intn(n)` function from `math/rand` library. Remember, the server creates random numbers in $[0, 2023)$ and you can try to guess them in order to gain/or lose money. 

We can try to go all random; however, that only guarantees us to get the correct answer in a probability of $\frac{1}{2023}$, and from the way the server rewards us, **+**$2022$ * `balance` for winning and **-**`balance` for losing, it seems like we will just be stuck in the same loop forever if we do that.



---

If only somehow you can find a hidden pattern in the way the server generates the numbers, which is just this line of code btw :333

```go
r := rand.Intn(2023)
```

then you can use it to predict future values, keep winning and rocketing yourself to your target `balance`. And from the title, you already know that it is possible. 

The reason this is feasible because the `math/rand` library *<u>"implements pseudo-random number generators"</u>* which is *<u>"unsuitable for security-sensitive work"</u>* according to [this link](https://pkg.go.dev/math/rand). It also states that *<u>"This package's outputs might be easily predictable regardless of how it's seeded."</u>* Great! But how predictable is it?



---

A **pseudo-random number generator**, or **PRNG**, like this would generate all of their supposed random numbers based on a `seed` value. If you know the `seed`, you basically become god and predict all `n` values in the bet game. 

As some players have pointed out, it is possible to recover the `seed` of Go's PRNG, because:

![](/images/posts/casino2/player-discussion-seed.png)

This means we just need to brute-force every value from $0$ to $2^{32} - 1 = 4294967295$, for which, in today's computer standards, can be done within an hour or so in a low-end laptop, 20 minutes if running multiple cores. For every `seed`, we set seed by `rand.Seed(seed)` then call `rand.Intn(2023)` a few times and compare the outputs with the server's `n`(s), which can be obtained for free by keep betting $0$ coins. When we've found and verified the `seed`, we just need to keep betting with our `balance` with `n = rand.Intn(2023)` to get the flag.

While it is very simple to setup the code to do this, an hour, to me, still feels like it's too much. If you code wrong *(probably you won't but who knows?)*, you would've to spend another hour to debug :slightly_smiling_face: Luckily tho, we can find the pattern of `rand.Intn(2023)` without the seed :wink:, thus solving this challenge in a matter of seconds.

## Finding pattern in `rand.Intn(n)`

### Graphing the Calls

```go
r := rand.Intn(2023)
```

Staring at a single line of code won't help a thing. So I decided to use the power of **ctrl-click-into-a-function-because-it-helps-us-going-back-to-its-definition-and-i-hope-i-could-have-a-better-name-for-this** in **VSCode** and dive into the code hierarchy and here is the progress:

<img src="/images/posts/casino2/backtracking.png"  />

---

As you can see, we've got pretty much everything up until the `Int63()` function. To look at the code for that, we need to go to `rng.go`, which is at the same directory as `rand.go` *(the reason I got this is because my friend found the code for `Int63()` at https://go.dev/src/math/rand/rng.go, and I was like wait aren't we also have this file in the system too?)*, and we've got the complete picture:

<img src="/images/posts/casino2/backtracking_v2.png"  />

---

While the above graph looks kinda crazy *(or not, idk...)*, when we create an abstract map for them, it is actually surprisingly simple if we just focus on the case where `n = 2023` or `n` is a relatively small number to $2^{31}$ in general.

<img src="/images/posts/casino2/abstraction.png"  />



### Formualize it

The graph above can be simplified as a formula in **Python**:

```python
rand.Intn(n) == ((rand.Uint64() & ((1<<63) - 1)) >> 32) % n  # n is small
```

Because taking the last $63$ bits then shift $32$ bits to the right is equivalent to shift $32$ bit to the right and taking the last 31 bits, we can rewrite it like this:

```python
rand.Intn(n) == ((rand.Uint64() >> 32) & ((1<<31) - 1)) % n	 # n is small
```

we can see that `& ((1<<31) - 1))` is just `% (2**31)`, so:

```python
rand.Intn(n) == (rand.Uint64() >> 32) % (2**31) % n			 # n is small
```

This implies if we have two Go programs set to the same `seed`, one outputting 1 number from `rand.Intn(n)` and the other outputting 1 number from `rand.Uint64()`, then the above equation holds.



---

... You're probably wondering why I keep mentioning `n` is small in the code comment. Well, the above statement *is not entirely true*. It only happens in **high probability** for small `n`. For big `n` $< 2^{31}$, `rand.Intn(n)` may call `rand.Uint64()` multiple times before outputting a number. If we investigate into the `rand.Int31n(n)` function, 

```go
func (r *Rand) Int31n(n int32) int32 {
	// ...
	max := int32((1 << 31) - 1 - (1<<31)%uint32(n))
	v := r.Int31()
	for v > max {
		v = r.Int31()
	}
	return v % n
}
```

you can see that there also exists a `max` variable, and we have to call `rand.Int31()` repeatedly until we hit a value `<= max`. If `n` is small, `max` would be very close to $2^{31}$, thus we most likely just need to call `rand.Int31()` only once for each `rand.Intn(n)`.

Oh, but there is an exception if `n` is a power of $2$. If `n` is $2^{\text{something}}$, every call to `rand.Intn(n)` will definitely call `rand.Int31()` once.

```go
// Int31n returns, as an int32, a non-negative pseudo-random number in the half-open interval [0,n).
// It panics if n <= 0.
func (r *Rand) Int31n(n int32) int32 {
	// ...
	if n&(n-1) == 0 { // n is power of two, can mask
		return r.Int31() & (n - 1)
	}
    // ...
```



### More Pattern

Consider $R$ a list of consecutive outputs from `rand.Intn(n)`, $S$ a list of consecutive outputs from `rand.Uint64()` setting to the same `seed` starting at the same time, when `n` is a small number $< 2^{31}$, we most likely have:
$$
R_i = (S_i \gg 32) \mod 2^{31} \mod n
$$
where $S_i, R_i$ is the $i$-th output of `rand.Uint64()` and `rand.Intn(n)`.



What's great about this formula is that we can now derive a pattern for `rand.Intn(n)` through the pattern of `rand.Uint64()`. And it turns out the pattern of `rand.Uint64()` is very simple. When you look at the code for `rand.Uint64()`, you can see it get output from `rng.vec` array while updating it.

```go
// /usr/lib/go-1.18/src/math/rand/rng.go
const (
	rngLen   = 607
	rngTap   = 273
	rngMax   = 1 << 63
	rngMask  = rngMax - 1
	int32max = (1 << 31) - 1
)

// ...
type rngSource struct {
	tap  int           // index into vec
	feed int           // index into vec
	vec  [rngLen]int64 // current feedback register
}

// ...

// Seed uses the provided seed value to initialize the generator to a deterministic state.
func (rng *rngSource) Seed(seed int64) {
	rng.tap = 0
	rng.feed = rngLen - rngTap
// ...

// Uint64 returns a non-negative pseudo-random 64-bit integer as an uint64.
func (rng *rngSource) Uint64() uint64 {
	rng.tap--
	if rng.tap < 0 {
		rng.tap += rngLen
	}

	rng.feed--
	if rng.feed < 0 {
		rng.feed += rngLen
	}

	x := rng.vec[rng.feed] + rng.vec[rng.tap]
	rng.vec[rng.feed] = x
	return uint64(x)
}
```

You don't need to know how the `rng.vec` is created to figure out a pattern for `rand.Uint64()`. Here, you just need to consider it to be a **bunch of random numbers**. The important thing you'll need to care is that `rng.vec`:

- only uses the numbers in it to update itself.

- the way it creates new number from older ones.

  

If you're familiar with the structure of **LFSR**, or **Linear Feedback Shift Register**, you would probably recognize this is kinda like that. The terms like **tap** and **feed** make more sense, and you can deduce the following relationship between some of the $S_i$(s):
$$
S_i = S_{i-\text{rngLen}} + S_{i-\text{rngTap}} \mod 2^{64} \\
\text{or} \\
S_i = S_{i-607} + S_{i-273} \mod 2^{64}
$$
*(while it is seemingly enough to conclude $S_i = S_{i-607} + S_{i-273}$ based on the `x := rng.vec[rng.feed] + rng.vec[rng.tap]` line, however since `rng.vec` is stored in an `int64` array, we have to include the$\mod 2^{64}$ in there.)*



### The tale of adding two numbers

*(i think this section is kinda overkill, but whatever -_-)*

What happens to the result when we **add two $b$-bit numbers** $A$ and $B$? Well, sometimes, the $A+B$ fits into a **$b$-bit value**. In this case, 
$$
A+B = A+B \mod 2^{b}
$$
![](/images/posts/casino2/adding_no_carry.png)

The other times, the result overflows, at most 1 bit into the left. In this case,
$$
A + B = (A + B \mod 2^{b}) + 2^b
$$
![](/images/posts/casino2/adding_carry.png)

What is also interesting when we add two numbers, is that if you ignore some of **$m$-lower bits** at the end, the addition in the higher bits is still true in some cases. This is essentially saying that,
$$
(A + B) \gg m = (A \gg m) + (B \gg m)
$$
![](/images/posts/casino2/adding_no_carry_lsb.png)

However, sometimes, since the addition in the lower $m$-bits *results in a carry*, we will also get this case:
$$
(A+B) \gg m = (A \gg m) + (B \gg m) + 1
$$
![](/images/posts/casino2/adding_carry_lsb.png)

### Piecing the puzzle together

> *(i'm not sure if this reasoning is correct... but I'll try my best)*

>  *(at first I was going to use the figures similar to the previous section but I don't know how, so I just stick with the formula, hope this make senses to all of you :slightly_smiling_face:)*

You're probably know where this is going. Because:
$$
S_i = S_{i-607} + S_{i-273} \mod 2^{64}
$$
... we have:
$$
S_i + \{0, 2^{64}\} = S_{i-607} + S_{i-273}
$$

> *(i dunno if the notation $+ \{a, b\}$ actually represents **add $a$** **or** $b$ or not... But that's what I meant :))*

... shift right both sides by $32$...
$$
(S_i \gg 32) + \{0, 2^{32}\} = (S_{i-607} \gg 32) + (S_{i-273} \gg 32) + \{0,1\}
$$

... and we reduce both sides$\mod 2^{31}$...
$$
(S_i \gg 32) \mod 2^{31} = (S_{i-607} \gg 32) + (S_{i-273} \gg 32) + \{0,1\} \mod 2^{31}
$$

>  *($\{0, 2^{32}\}$ vanishes cuz $0$ or $2^{32}$ equals $0$ mod $2^{31}$)*

But this also means:
$$
(S_i \gg 32) \mod 2^{31} = ((S_{i-607} \gg 32) \mod 2^{31}) + ((S_{i-273} \gg 32) \mod 2^{31}) - \{0, 2^{31}\} + \{0,1\}
$$

Now the final ingredient, taking$\mod n$ on both sides, and **voilà!**:
$$
R_i = R_{i-607} + R_{i-273} - \{0, 2^{31}\} + \{0, 1\} \mod n

### Take your `balance` to the infinity and beyond :rocket:

Now we've known how the outputs of `rand.Intn(n)` are related. We can collect numbers generated by the server into a list $R$ by just **betting** random numbers in $[0, 2023)$. You can bet $0$ coin units to prevent yourself from losing money. 

After $607$ numbers are collected, you choose from one of the 4 possibilities that states either the next output $R_i$ is:
$$
R_i = R_{i-607} + R_{i-273} \mod {n}
\\ \text{or} \\
R_i = R_{i-607} + R_{i-273} + 1 \mod {n}
\\ \text{or} \\
R_i = R_{i-607} + R_{i-273} - 2^{31} \mod {n}
\\ \text{or} \\
R_i = R_{i-607} + R_{i-273} - 2^{31} + 1 \mod {n}
$$
and bet $R_i$ with that guess.

Because win amount is $2022$ times bigger than lose amount, while our possibility of hitting the correct answer is $\frac{1}{4}$, our money will be increasing in the long run. If we bet with some `amount` that is proportional to `balance` like `balance`/2, this allows our money to grow exponentially, makes it easy to hit some crazy big number like $2^{400}$ in no time.

>  *(i'm not sure that's optimal or not... but `balance`/2 works so I don't think too much about that :slightly_smiling_face:)*

When you get $2^{400}$ coin units, you request `showBalanceWithProof` to get `proofData` then submit it along with your `balance` to `PrintFlag` to grab some flag! *(yey)*

### Modifying dockerfile

Yeah, building a docker for this challenge sucks, because it keeps yelling at us that there's no `go.sum` file :< So we decided to fix the `Dockerfile`, add a `compose.yml` file so that we can just `docker compose` it, making our lives easier :slightly_smiling_face: . Here are them 2 files:

#### Dockerfile (modified)

```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.19-alpine

RUN apk add socat

RUN addgroup -S casino && adduser -S casino -G casino
USER casino:casino
WORKDIR /home/casino

# Create go.mod file
COPY ./go.mod .
RUN go mod download

# This is just for a reminder to put a flag file in here :)
COPY ./flag .  

# Copy everything else and build binary.
COPY . .
RUN go get casino 
RUN mkdir ./build
RUN go build -o ./build/casino

EXPOSE 31339

CMD socat -T 30 -d -d TCP-LISTEN:31339,reuseaddr,fork EXEC:"./build/casino"
```

#### compose.yml

```Dockerfile
services:
    casino2:
        build: .
        ports:
            - "31339:31339"
```

After starting the container, you can connect to `localhost:31339` to play the challenge :kissing:
